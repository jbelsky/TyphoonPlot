Description: Provides both processing and graphics helper functions to create a
    Typhoon Plot, which is a two-dimensional visualization method of paired-end
    next-generation sequencing reads.  The x-axis represents the genomic
    position, and the y-axis the fragment length.  Typhoon Plots are created
    first by creating a data matrix, and are then subsequently displayed
    using the DensDotPlot function, a wrapper for the base image() function
